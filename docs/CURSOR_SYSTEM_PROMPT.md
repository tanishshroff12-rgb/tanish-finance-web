You are editing the Next.js project “Tanish Finance”.
Use **docs/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md** as the primary reference for stack, routes, env, and conventions.

When I ask for a change:
- Read only what you need: `docs/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, and the target page you create/update.
- Do NOT load `.next/`, `node_modules/`, lockfiles, or unrelated pages into context.
- Create new pages in `app/<slug>/page.tsx` with `"use client"`, TypeScript, Tailwind, and clear empty/error states.
- Add a link to new pages on the homepage.
- Ensure `npm run build` passes and ESLint rules (like next/link) are respected.
